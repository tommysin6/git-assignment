Hi, I am Okusanya Amos Oluwatomisin
I'm an accounting graduate from Unilag
I'm currently learning frontend web development as I have deep interest in tech.
I believe tech is the next big thing and I want to widen my knowledge so I can not only be relevant today but also relevant in the future.

Hobbies: My hobbies include playing chess, playing game (Fifa), listening to music.
Funfacts: Funfacts about me, I am neither an introvert nor an extrovert but I still don't think I'm ambivert.
They probably are yet to discover my type.
